Writing documentation
----------------------

We are using Mallard to write the documentation.  Mallard
is a subset of Docbook XML with some variations in order
to make easier the process of writing documentation for
applications.

The documentation has not been included in the installation
setup yet, because it only has a general skeleton.

In order to test the see the formated pages, you should run
yelp giving the full path to the directory of the documentation.

For instance:
$ yelp /home/foo/code/postr/help/C


Mallard resources
-----------------

Mallard offers an easy format.  You would like to start at:
http://www.gnome.org/~shaunm/mallard/

It is recommended to look read some tips from Milo
Casagrande at:
http://milocasagrande.wordpress.com/2009/10/25/long-time-but-mallard-alive/

As usual, looking what other do to get the things done may also
help.  For instance, reading the documentation's source of
Empathy at:
http://git.gnome.org/cgit/empathy/tree/help/C/?h=gnome-2-28
